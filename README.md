### 🧩 Who I Am
I build at the crossroads of **technology, creativity, and precision**.  
As a B.S./M.S. student in **IT Management at WGU**, I merge cybersecurity, AI, and automation into systems that move intelligently — just like the music I create and the events I help curate.

My mindset: **structure creates freedom** — whether I’m designing secure architectures or mixing soundscapes that hit both logically and emotionally.

### 🚀 What I'm Building
- 🧠 **Secure RAG Agent** — a Retrieval-Augmented Generation demo using GPT-4, LangChain, and FastAPI.  
  Shows how AI, backend logic, and cybersecurity principles can align cleanly in one system.
- ☁️ Expanding into **cloud automation**, **Zero-Trust design**, and **AI-driven decision frameworks**.
- 🎧 Producing as **DJ JO**, bridging rhythm, code, and consciousness — crafting experiences that blend data with energy.
